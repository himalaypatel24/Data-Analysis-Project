**911 is an emergency telephone number for the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).
Analysing emergency calls dataset and discovering hidden trends and patterns will help in ensuring that the emergency response team is better equipped to deal with emergencies.**

**Considering road accidents, fire accidents etc, high numbers in specific areas indicate that there is a high demand for ambulance services in those areas. Road accidents in some areas might be due to road conditions which need to be improved. High frequency of emergencies due to respiratory problems might be due to harmful pollutants in the air in that specific area. Association rule mining will thus help in discovering such patterns.**
